# Super-tiny-compiler in Go
This is a ongoing rewrite of James Kyle's [the-super-tiny-compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler)
in Go. The original super-tiny-compiler is written in JS, so I thought
this could be an easy way to get started with programming in Go.

All the credit goes to James Kyle for this great introduction to compilers.
